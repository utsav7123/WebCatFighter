### Step 4: Update your game to use the real server
1. Open `game.js`
2. Find the line with `// const SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:3000';`

### If deployment fails:
- Check that `package.json` exists
- Verify all dependencies are listed
- Make sure `server.js` is in the root directory

### If rooms don't work:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the SERVER_URL is correctly set
- Test with different devices/networks
